From cobra vs mongoose to lion vs tiger we countdown the top 14 biggest animal fights caught on camera. Shocking fight, between a giraffe and a lion in the plains of Africa, most would assume that the giraffe would be defeated easily by the king of the jungle. However, this is no jungle and the giraffe manages to use its long legs and high jumps to stomp the lion repeatedly, causing the giraffe to win the fight. In this amazing video, two rather small but deadly animals go head to head. The cobra and mongoose take shots at each other respectively. Until the mongoose gets a firm bite on the head of the poisonous snake, and making itself the unexpected winner. In this fight in the Australian outback, a giant snake and a crocodile take each other on. At first the crocodile grabs the snake between its teeth. The python snake then coils itself around the crocodile, and strangling it. The fight lasted for hours, but the snake emerges victorious. In this shocking fight, a jaguar slowly emerges behind an exacting crocodile in the wetlands of Brazil. The jaguar sinks it teeth into the back of the crocodile in order to constrict the crocodile. The jaguar then carries off its prey, after the destruction it has just caused to the crocodile. In this video, a cobra snake has just discovered a nest of mongooses. As it plots to sliver in, a mongoose uses a tunnel to sneak up behind the snake a strike. The mongoose bites the snake in the head and they begin attacking each other. The snake then wraps up the mongoose in an attempt to strangle it. However, the mongoose frees itself, and begins to take painful bites at the cobra, eventually killing it. In this video, a shark is peacefully swimming through ocean territory. However, it’s swim is interrupted when an octopus disguised as coral rises up and wraps its tentacles around the shark. The giant pacific octopus was able to easily defeat the shark in this unlikely match up, despite the octopus being far lower down in the food chain. During this animal fight between an hyena and a pack of lions, the hyena uses their amazing dexterity to run quickly away from the lion pack. However, the hyena was soon caught up to by the pack, as they surround it and begin to bite it. In this unlikely match-up, a cobra and an eagle to head to head. The eagle tries to use its size to stand and peck at the cobra. But the cobra fights back attempting to bite back. However, on one bite when the cobra’s mouth is open, the eagle strikes and bites the cobra in the mouth. In this wild battle, recorded deep in the jungle a tiger and a huge lion go head to head. The pair spend hours wrestling and biting one another to see who the real king of the jungle is. When suddenly the tiger rolls over in defeat, after hours of fighting with the massive lion. In this shocking piece of footage from South Africa, a lion who is attacking a buffalo is suddenly changed at by 2 other buffalos. The lion is the launched 4 meters into the air by the giant male buffalo. The animals scuffled for a little while longer, but all walked away with no major injuries. Despite this, we think it’s pretty safe to say that the buffalo won this round.

10 Unbelievable Animals that Saved Other Animals

It seems like a lot of us here love animals! I mean, who doesn’t? They are good companions and they’re fun to look at. Whether it’s at home, in the zoo or in the wild, animals definitely bring a lot of happiness to our lives. Also, there are a lot of good things we can learn from the animal kingdom, and heroism is one of them. There have been many times in which animals have put their lives at risk for the sake of others that are completely different to them. Today we’ll be looking at some of the most unbelievable animals that saved other animals. You’ll be surprised to see the animals in action, rescuing others in ways that even a human would never be able to. Make sure you see which act of heroism is on top of this list! These animal heroes will surely shock you.

The Bear and The Crow

Bears are fluffy and cute...when you look at them from far! But in reality, they are quite majestic and intimidating. If you remember well, they’re some of the biggest animals on land and they can be quite threatening if you were to find them in the wild. Not only they will steal your food, but they can make a meal out of you if they decided to. So how can one of them become a hero to a dying bird? I mean, look at them, they’re so big and birds are so little! That is something that I can’t explain, but it happened in the Budapest Zoo and here is a video of this rescue in which a bear helped a crow after finding the bird in the water, very close to drowning. For a moment it seemed like the bear was desperate to get its claws on the poor crow and take advantage of it. However, once the bird was out, the bear was back to whatever he was doing and the bird was able to live. 

The Dolphin and the Whale

Whales beaching themselves seems to be quite common. While the situation is a mystery to us humans, we are always eager to help them out and send them back to the ocean when we see a problem like that. This is exactly what happened in New Zealand, when a whale beached itself and a group of people came to the rescue, pushing the big animal back into the water. However, their efforts seemed to have little effect as the whale kept coming back to shore. The humans were ready to give up when a famous dolphin came over to offer some help. The dolphin communicated with the whale and the animal quickly followed. It seemed like the whale went from being stressed and scared to hopeful and confident in just a matter of seconds. Despite the effort of many humans, all the whale needed was just another aquatic friend to tell him what to do.

The Rottweiler that Saved a Smaller Dog

Alright, a dog saving another dog doesn’t seem that impressive or unbelievable at first. After all, they’re the same species. But wait ‘til you hear this story! It was early one morning in a suburban neighborhood when a small dog’s owners stepped away from their little dog Trixxie, not knowing that a coyote was ready to prey on their small pet. It only took a few seconds for the coyote to attack Trixxie and start carrying the little dog away. Luckily for Trixxie, the neighbor’s Rottweiler heard the noise and immediately came to the rescue of his fellow canine friend.  He jumped on the coyote, which gave Trixxie a chance to escape. The Rottweiler, being so protective and territorial, made sure to chase the coyote far away from the property. I’m sure this coyote didn’t come back for a second time! 

The Orangutan and The Chicken

And once again, another bird was drowning. This time it was a chicken and its hero an orangutan. You can’t expect anything less from these intelligent primates. However, being such a big animal in comparison to the small chick, it took the orangutan some work to get the bird to safety. After a first attempt, the chicken was back again in the water, but the orangutan didn’t just give up. All it took was for the orangutan to put a leaf right in front of the bird so it could lacht on to it. The orangutan then placed the bird on the grass and gently stroked it. This act shows heroism, but it also shows the ape’s complex intelligence and caring nature. It must have been great to witness this act."

On this episode of Breaking Trail, witness the EPIC conclusion of Coyote Peterson’s climb up the insect sting pain index! What started as a simple curiosity with Harvester Ant stings has now evolved and captured the world’s attention in one man’s quest to document the most painful insect stings from around the globe. You’ve already seen some of his worst stings, from the Velvet Ant and the Tarantula Hawk to the Bullet Ant and Warrior Wasp. Now in what may be his final pain index challenge ever, Coyote takes on the much-anticipated sting of the Executioner Wasp! 

The Executioner Wasp is a beautiful gold and amber paper wasp, one of the largest living in the dense jungles of Central and South America. These pollinators, that use their strong mandibles to bring nectar and small caterpillars back to the nest to feed their young, are actually not very aggressive. However, don’t let their level of chill fool you, these speedy wasps pack a seriously powerful punch that can cause major injury and even death with its potential for allergic reactions. 

Now the time has come for Coyote to return to home of the Bullet Ant and Warrior Wasp to be stung by an Executioner Wasp! Will it be his worst and take the throne atop the sting index?  

Get ready, you’re about to watch the epic conclusion to Coyote’s climb up the Sting Pain Index –  it’s time for Coyote to get STUNG by an EXECUTIONER WASP! 

Breaking Trail leaves the map behind and follows adventurer and animal expert Coyote Peterson and his crew as they encounter a variety of wildlife in the most amazing environments on the planet!

FILM DESCRIPTION:
Previously thought to be extinct, a massive creature attacks a deep-sea submersible, leaving it disabled and trapping the crew at the bottom of the Pacific. With time running out, a visionary oceanographer recruits rescue diver Jonas Taylor to save the crew and the sea itself from an unimaginable threat -- a 75-foot-long prehistoric shark known as the Megalodon.

I decided not to exchange the audio with music because when I played the video back, I realized my overly dramatic reaction was funny. Yes, I know I have a country accent.

A new species of bird of paradise has been hiding under our noses. This is the male Vogelkop superb bird of paradise, found in Western New Guinea. It was originally thought to be the same bird as the famous ""smiley face"" superb bird of paradise. Recent observations show that their courtship characteristics are different. The Vogelkop's black cape is less oval, and its blue breast feathers look more like a ""frowny face."" Its courtship dance is less bouncy when it circles a potential mate. The Cornell Lab of Ornithology has been conducting an eight-year-long Birds-of-Paradise Project.

This is Mischief the White-Necked Raven.  These ravens are found throughout eastern and southern Africa, and are common near human habitation.  

Like all members of the Corvidae family, ravens are extremely intelligent. They use tools to get food if necessary, and can even mimic human speech! 

Cool facts about White-Necked Ravens:

- Their main diet is fruit, insects, and small reptiles, but if they find a small tortoise to eat, they will lift it up and drop it to the ground to break the shell.

- Ravens are some of the smartest of all animals.

- Since they are very social by nature, ravens are also some of the most playful of birds. 

- Ravens display a strange behavior in the wild called ""anting"".  They roll around on anthills, let the ants crawl all over them, and then they chew up the ants and rub them through their feathers.  Scientists are unsure why they do this.

Hello. I'm Charles from Louis Purple, and today I'm going to teach you how to tie a Windsor knot. The Windsor knot is actually a very simple knot to tie, and it's very useful because it projects confidence. So it's a wide, triangular knot that's very suitable for presentations, job interviews, or cultural appearances, which I hope you don't frequent too often. So this is how you start. 

You just find the right balance depending on the length of your tie, with the wide end on the right hand side and the narrow end on the left. You might want to adjust exactly where the center of the tie should be at in the middle of your neck. So this is how you start. You cross over the wide end over the narrow end. You bring the wide end through the loop between the collar and the tie. And you bring the wide end back down. 

Then you just pull the wide end underneath, and then bring it up through the loop again in order to have a symmetrical shape, which should look like this. And you're almost done. There's only the easy part left and the most rewarding. Pull the wide end in front. Bring the wide end underneath, and then slide it inside the loop and tie it in the knot. You draw the knot up in order to fit your collar. So it's a knot that's really suitable for widespread collars. And as I said, then you can just adjust and tighten how big of a knot you like to obtain. This is how you tie a Windsor knot."

TRANSCRIPT

Hi there, I’m going to show you one of the most popular ways to tie a tie – using the Windsor knot – also known as the Double Windsor or the Full Windsor. Start with your collar up and the tie around your neck. If you are right handed, hold the wide end of the tie in your right hand and the narrow end of the tie in your left hand. Now, it is important to remember that the longer you make the wide end, the lower the tie will hang when you are finished. Basically, you want to line up your tie like this. If you remember this, you will save yourself a lot of time later on. Now cross each end over – wide end over the top – and leave about this much on the narrow end. That is about four inches or ten centimetres. With your left hand, take the wide end of the tie. Thread it through the back of this opening from behind. Thread it all the way through, like this. Now take the wide end of the tie, and with your left hand, wrap it all the way around the back like this. Switch hands. Notice here how the back of the tie is facing outward. Taking the wide end, now, in your right hand, thread it through the front of this opening. Alright! The hardest part is now done; the rest is easy! What you can see here is the inside of your knot. It should look a bit like a triangle. Put your left index finger on the knot, like this, and keep it there. With your other hand, wrap the wide end around the knot, from right to left – and then grab it from behind. Keep your index finger where it is. With your right hand, push the wide end through this opening again – from the back. Alright, here comes the punch-line! Your index finger has created a little tunnel. What you need to do now is thread the tie down through the tunnel. The last step now is to adjust and tighten it – alternating between the long end and the short end of the tie – gradually pulling the knot up – shaping it as you go – until the tie is just how you want it to be – a sharp, symmetrical, triangular knot. Pull your collar down – and bingo! – a full Windsor knot. Thank you for watching. I hope you found this helpful.

Today’s dressing rules don’t require men to wear a suit and tie to work every day, but everybody has a special occasion from time to time, and that’s when this piece of clothing comes into play. 

There are knots that are really simple to tie. But you should know that it doesn’t fit all occasions. There are situations that require other types of knots. For example, the Full Windsor knot is probably the most official one, and the Victoria knot is more casual. So if you have no idea what to do with this long stretch of cloth, then here're all the fancy ways to tie it!

SUMMARY:
- The Oriental Knot is the simplest to tie. If you learn how to do that,  you will be able to manage the level one knot!
- The Half Windsor knot is a tougher knot to tie, but it’s totally worth it. It’s medium-sized and symmetrical, which makes it more official and yet makes you look more slender.
- The Full Windsor knot is a large knot for longer ties that’s probably the most official one. It also makes your neck look thicker, which adds to the masculinity.
- If you want a more easy-to-tie option of the Half Windsor knot, Saint Andrew is your choice. It will be a medium-sized, symmetrical knot good for any formal occasion.
- Want a smaller and more casual knot on your tie? Learn all about the Victoria tie knot. 
- Finally, if you’re up for a challenge and ready for experiments, here’s the Eldredge knot for you. It’ll certainly turn some heads!

How To Potty Train a Puppy?

Housetraining a puppy can be as difficult as training a baby. One of the main tips anyone can use is to be consistent in your training methods. 
There are many different methods you can use to train your puppy and some work better for certain pets than others.

Your puppy is young and is learning every day, so you will have a better chance of them learning faster if you do the same thing every day.

Successful housetraining is based on setting the pup up for success by limiting him to the fewest possible accidents, then praising the puppy whenever it has done the right thing. 

Here are some tips that every pet owner can use to better their success chances at puppy potty training:

What's the 44 Club? Well it all started in the outro of this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyLPMhp7qbs where we wondered if anyone was still watching the video at that point, and to comment 44 (Scott's fave number) if they were. Brett then said 44 Club get on board and the rest is history. The 44Club is the official How Ridiculous fan club made up of people who love our videos and watch them right to the very end. We've even got 44 Club merch now! So yeh, that's the story. Pretty random but good fun at the same time.

We are passionate about seeing children released from poverty and we would love you to consider sponsoring a child with Compassion. We visited our sponsor children in the Philippines and were blown away by the difference that child sponsorship can make. To find out more about sponsoring a child right now, check out: http://cmpsn.co/howridiculous

What Slow Mo Camera Do We Use? We've got the The Chronos 1.4 which shoots 1500fps at 720p. Check it out here http://bit.ly/KrontechChronos

Worst Aviation Disasters And Plane Crashes In History

Lauda Air Flight 004 - 223 dead: On 26 May 1991 flight 004 from Bangkok to Vienna broke up in the air near the Burma-Thailand border after the thrust reverser on the left wing fired. Reports indicate that it’s subsequent dive could have exceeded mach 1 (the sound barrier). There were no survivors.

China Airlines Flight 611 - 225 dead: On 25 May 2002 flight 611 from Taiwan to Hong Kong disintegrated mid flight due to faulty repairs 22 years earlier.

Korean Air Flight 801 - 228 dead: Despite protests from the flight engineer that the captain was not detecting the correct signal for landing, he pressed on and guided flight 801 from Seoul, South Korea directly into the Guam mountainside leaving only 26 survivors.

Air France Flight 447 - 228 dead: 1 June 2009 flight 447 disappeared on its way to Paris from Rio de Janeiro. Although the wreckage was found after 5 days the black box was recovered 2 years later. The cause was found to be an inappropriate pilot response to faulty air speed indicators due to bad weather conditions and ice.

Swissair Flight 111 - 229 dead:On 2 September 1998 Swissair flight 111 from New York to Geneva crashed into the ocean just off of Nova Scotia due to a rapidly spreading cockpit fire.

9/11 flights:Although not a single air disaster, the four flights involved in 9/11 were responsible for the greatest single day loss of life in commercial aviation history. Two of the flights, American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175 each were responsible for thousands of casualties after being driven into the World Trade Centers and are considered the largest and second largest losses of life due to individual plane crashes in all of aviation history with 1700 and 1000 people killed respectively.

Tenerife Airport Disaster - 583 dead: In terms of passengers and crew killed this collision between two Boeing 747s on the Spanish Island of Tenerife is considered the deadliest plane crash in history.

Japan Airlines Flight 123 - 520 dead:On August 12, 1985 a flight from Tokyo to Osaka crashed into Mount Takamagahara leaving only 4 survivors.

Charkhi Dadri mid-air collision - 349 dead: The deadliest mid-air collision in history, Saudi Arabian airlines and Kazakhstan airlines crashed just west of New Delhi killing everyone on both planes. An investigation found that once again a lack of English language skills on behalf of the Kazakh pilots was the primary cause.

Ermenonville air disaster - 346 dead:After a Moroccan baggage handler was unable to read the proper latching instructions in either English or Turkish on Turkish airlines flight 981, the latch blew off mid flight as the plane crashed into Ermonville forest near Paris, France. Furthermore, the latches had a known design flaw.

Air India Flight 182 - 329 dead:On the 23 of June, 1985 a bomb exploded onboard Air India Flight 182 as it was flying between London and Montreal. The plane crashed into the Atlantic Ocean just off the coast of Ireland. A Canadian Sikh militant group was responsible.

Saudia Flight 163 - 301 dead:This flight from Rihadh to Jeddah caught fire shortly after takeoff. It turned around and made an emergency landing but everyone on board died of smoke inhalation before fire crews could get inside. The fire was started due to butane stoves used by Muslim pilgrims because of their strict dietary restrictions. Saudi Arabia has since banned the stoves but some people still smuggle them onboard to make tea.

Iran Air Flight 655 - 290 dead: During the Iraq-Iran on July 3, 1988 the USS Vincennes shot down Iran Air Flight 665 going between Tehran and Dubai due to confused communications.

Iranian Air Force - 275 dead: On the 19th of February, 2003 an Iranian Air Force plane carrying Revolutionary Guards on an unknown mission crashed into the mountains near Kerman leaving no survivors.

Today I'm snowboarding on Blackcomb mountain with my friend Doug who's learning to hit larger jumps in the terrain park! Doug has had a couple days of hitting smaller jumps and box features on his snowboard. We start the day with a couple warm up laps through the small terrain park getting warmed up and minds thinking about jumps. Next we went through the medium terrain park and took a look at all the jumps. Once we were warmed up on our snowboards and looked at the jumps, we were ready to hit the first jump! The first tip for hitting jumps on your snowboard is to get the speed right, so you can clear the knuckle. A great way to get the speed right is to watch other snowboarders hit the jump first. You can also build your confidence by hitting smaller snowboard jumps. Another key for clearing the knuckle is to get a small pop off the takeoff. This will get you more height in the air to make that landing. Practicing the pop or ollie on the snow and small jumps first so you can use it for landing bigger jumps. The final key in jump progression is to land with your snowboard level. When Doug was first learning to jump he was landing on his tail first, but with some practice he was able to level out the landing. Check out the snowboard trick playlist for more tips on jumps and trick progression! Thanks for watching!

131,Rooftop Skiing in France | Good Morning By Richard Permin,1824357,Red Bull,258,38285.0,624.0,"Check out Richard Permin's latest video: rooftop freestyle skiing in Avoriaz 1800, France.

Certain days can be really original… They depend on where you live and what you do! Richard Permin’s everyday life for instance is definitely out of the ordinary.
In Good Morning, his latest video project, Richard endlessly repeats his morning routine. Right after getting out of bed, he clicks into his skis and rides down the snow-covered rooftops of Avoriaz. Richard is throwing one backflip after another at a vertiginous height before executing insane tricks on the wooden facades and in the streets of the French ski resort.

This ambitious project was initiated three years ago, but in January 2016, Richard broke his two heels on a severe landing after jumping from one of the rooftops. 
After hundreds of hours of physical therapy, he’s making a spectacular come back among the elite of freeski, to complete this unfinished chapter of his athlete life.

The Third Eye Chakra transcends time. It is located at the brow, above the base of the nose.

The gift of this chakra is seeing - both inner and outer worlds. The energy of this chakra allows us to experience clear thought as well as gifts of spiritual contemplation and self reflection.

Through the gift of seeing we can internalize the outer world and with symbolic language we can externalize the inner world.

The energy of Ajna allows us to access our inner guidance that comes from the depths of our being. It allows us to cut through illusion and to access deeper truths - to see beyond the mind, beyond the words.

The ""way of the third eye"" is seeing everything as it is from a point of ""witness"" or ""observer"", or from simply being mindful - moment by moment.

It means examining self-limiting ideas and developing wisdom that comes from a perspective that transcends the duality of good or bad, black or white. It means seeing and helping others to see the deeper meanings of the situations in their lives.

Sixth chakra is holistic in nature. When this chakra is fully activated, both hemispheres of the brain function in synchrony. The right hemisphere's creativity and synthetic thinking is integrated and balanced with left hemisphere's logical and analytical thinking.
The Third Eye is not only the seat of wisdom, but also a seat of conscience. This is where you not only see what is going on, but you also know what it means. This is where your sense of justice and your ethics originate. When your third eye is open, you not only see but you also understand.

Hey everybody!! Back in early mid-December 2019, as part of my ""4th Quarter 2019"" Food Challenge Tour, I flew from Tampa, Florida up to Cleveland, Ohio so I could attempt 4 delicious food challenges around the Toledo and Cleveland, Ohio areas. For challenge #1, I went to downtown Toledo, Ohio location of Balance Pan-Asian Grill. There are multiple locations around Toledo and Cleveland. We helped them kick off their new ""Bang Bang"" Spicy Pan-Asian Food Challenge which featured something from each main part of their menu. I had just 10 short minutes to finish a trio of 3 tacos, a portion of nachos, and one of their Indian Budda (Buddha) Bowls, and each was covered with Balance Grille's spicy Bang Bang Sauce (12 oz total). Thanks so much to the owners, management, and staff for the wonderful food and hospitality, and thanks to all the amazing people who came up to watch and meet me that evening!! We appreciate everyone around Toledo and the rest of Ohio watching our videos and supporting our efforts!! The next new video will feature a biscuits and gravy breakfast challenge in Galion, Ohio, followed by two Cleveland area food challenges.

Summary:  I made a bowling ball with James Bruton where it will steer left and right depending on how you lean.  People lean anyways when the bowl to try and influence the direction so we just capitalized on that.  It operates on the same principles of a BB8 ball.

150,14 Computer Tricks You Wish You Learned Sooner,1949684,BRIGHT SIDE,543,33741.0,3366.0,"There are 3 types of computer users: the ones who use their mouse, those who use their keyboard, and those who prefer talking to Cortana or Siri. No matter which category you fall into, you can’t deny the immense usefulness of certain shortcuts and hacks that reveal the unknown possibilities your computer always had. These smart tricks improve your everyday computer experience and give an absolute boost in your productivity and in your security.

We collected 14 computer hacks that will be massively helpful to anyone using their computer for fun or business.

TIMESTAMPS:

2. Ask Google about any problem you’re facing before going to a PC expert 1:24
3. For currency conversions, use the Google search bar instead of a calculator 1:57
4. A laptop battery charges faster when in airplane mode 2:27
5. Download any Google image automatically by pressing Alt and clicking on it 2:57
6. Hide your IP address so that nobody sees what you’re doing 3:29

Music by Epidemic Sound  https://www.epidemicsound.com/ 

SUMMARY:
- Opening new tabs is an action that you do countless times during the day. Instead of doing it manually with your mouse, you can simply press “ctrl” and the letter T and a new tab will open.
- You can type your problem into the Google search bar and read what Microsoft or the various tech forums have to tell you.
- If you’re traveling abroad and you need to see how much money you will get with the exchange, you can simply write down the amount of money and the currencies of the country where you’re traveling.
- When your laptop is on airplane mode it means that many features, like your Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, are disabled. This takes some pressure off your battery and allows it to charge faster than if operating normally.
- You can simply push “alt” and then left click on an image and it will be automatically saved on your computer in your Downloads folder. 
- There are various ways that can hide your IP address and make your browsing invisible. You need to install a good VPN on your internet browser so that it changes your real location.
- Most computers have the night shift mode, which adjusts the brightness during the night.
- If you are having problems with your computer’s speed, it might be the fact that your desktop is full of icons. Instead of having a folder for every little thing on your desktop, you can create one folder and organize everything in there.
- If you don’t just want to change your password, but also find out who the thief (or thieves) are, then you can download Who Is on My Wi-Fi and maybe go confront them.
- Deleting files and then emptying the recycling bin can prove to be very frustrating. What you can do is download Recuva, which is the top program to recover permanently deleted files.
-Millions of people get hacked every day and you might be one of them at some point. Seeing your antivirus being turned off is one of the first serious signs.
- Another tremendously useful shortcut is the one that exits your web browser. In this case, you press “ctrl” and then the letter Q.
- When combining the “ctrl” key and the letter I there are various things that can happen in a total of 147 different programs. However, the most ordinary and common use of the combo is to turn text in Word and other text editing programs from normal style into italics.

154,The new supercomputer behind the US nuclear arsenal,2214786,Verge Science,481,36755.0,1793.0,"“Sierra” was just crowned the second-most powerful supercomputer on the planet. And while most of its peers use their power for climate simulations, astrophysics, and other civilian work, Sierra is purpose-built for an entirely different mission: nuclear weapons. We took a tour of this massive system, and found out why the US builds supercomputers to support its nuclear arsenal.

The Computer Kit is the first computer anyone can make and
code. First, you put the pieces together, like LEGO. Then you power on
your computer and learn to code by making games, music, apps and art. Step by step for beginners of all ages.

158,How to Unclog a Kitchen Sink,2198754,HowToWith GEO,508,6943.0,815.0,"When you have a really bad sink clog, sometimes using a plunger or
plumbers snake just wont get through the clog. In these situations you
may need to start opening up pipes. In most cases the problem is near
the P-trap which is directly under the sink. This video will show you
how it's done."
159,King Cobra Found Hiding Under Kitchen Sink,45030,Viral Press,81,14.0,1.0,"A 13ft long king cobra was caught hiding under the kitchen sink. Housewife Nai Pattaraporn, 40, spotted the huge python laying on the cool tiles in Krabi, southern Thailand last Saturday (28/12) evening while she was preparing dinner. 

The resident said she was terrified after noticing the deadly reptile. She said: ""I was extremely shocked when I saw the snake hiding under the sink counter. I recovered my thoughts before calling the rescue workers to catch the snake.""

Reptile specialists rushed to the scene and spent only five minutes using equipment to capture the fierce snake. The python struggled to escape but it was finally taken into the sack.

One of the rescuers said: ""The snake may have been looking for food while there was a shortage in the wild. If anyone finds reptiles rampaging through the house, do not hesitate to call the rescue volunteers.""

The king cobra was estimated to be 13ft long before it was released back into the jungle.

160,How To Unclog a Kitchen Sink Drain (Fast and Cheap Method),4057754,Natural Cures,149,22450.0,2522.0,"In today’s video we’re going to show you a cheap, natural alternative to unclog your kitchen sink.

Whenever you’re washing dishes and start noticing that water in the sink is backing up, that means that the drain is probably clogged. This problem will most likely end up happening to someone who isn’t careful and doesn’t take the most basic precautions. 

Most of the time, the back up happens due to a build up of fat in the pipes. When we rinse fat down the drain it’s normally liquid, but ends up congealing and blocking pipes.

Pieces of food and vegetable or fruit peel can also pile up where the pipes curve and keep the water from flowing.

So what do you do when this happens? Do you call a plumber? Do you buy a chemical product to unclog your sink?

Most people probably don’t know that these product contain harmful substances that can cause skin irritations and breathing problems. 

Do you have any other tips for unclogging sink drains? Tell us about them in the comment section!

To enter the giveaway for a Disposalift tool, just FOLLOW me on Instagram and COMMENT on the Disposalift image. Thats it! 
My Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/adamdiy.me/

In this video I replace a kitchen sink from cast iron to stainless steel.  The common problems you may run into are: leaking shutoff valves when you turn them back on, pipes the wrong length after the swap and under-tightening the new drains thus causing leaks.   If you are set on buying stainless steel, it is worth it to spend the extra money for a good one.  Make sure the sink is deep and the metal thick! It matters!  Best of luck on your repair.

179,The Original New York Slice: The Pizza Show,5434798,Munchies,1452,45914.0,1437.0,"New York is the birthplace of many things, but for today's purposes, we're sticking to pizza. Frank starts with a quick history lesson from Scott Wiener, the owner of Scott's Pizza Tours. Then, we hit the streets to see and taste the history for ourselves. The best thing about the city's pizza scene is that it's relatively young, so you can still eat slices from the ovens of the people that started it all and put New York pizza on the map. 

We meet the granddaughters of the man that literally brought pizza over from Naples, and even see the ovens that he used. Then, we hit all the best slices from Greenwich Village to Soho, and finish in Brooklyn at Luigi's Pizza, a place untouched by time.

Following is a transcript of the video:

Amelia Singer: Hi my name is Amelia Singer and I’m a wine expert, TV presenter on the wine show, and I run my own wine tasting and consultancy business, Amelia’s wine.

Everyone thinks red wine and cheese is really great. I know it’s really romantic and it’s the iconic image of valentines day or some kind of rom-com, but guys it really doesn’t do justice to either the wine or the cheese. If you really love both, then you think about this.

So effectively cheese can have quite a lot of acidity, particularly goat’s and sheep’s cheeses and hard cheeses and when you match it with a red wine, which often doesn’t have the same acidity and actually normally has quite a bit of tannin and alcohol. What’s going to happen is it’s going to clash and only exacerbates the acidity, and the tannin, and the alcohol levels. It’s going to dry out your wine, and it’s going to completely dry out your cheese. No, go.

My own personal pet peeve is that white wine is served too cold and red wine is served too warm. Why is this important? Well, when a wine is cold it basically mutes it and means that it’s not able to express its aroma and its full range of flavour compounds, now if you have a really cheap insipid white wine that’s fine; my mother’s Pinot Grigio with ice.

However if you are having something more complex, or something which is really meant to be fruity and perfumed then take it outside the fridge, maybe pour it in your glass and maybe let it open up a bit for 5 minutes. Same thing for reds, often particularly with really light, aromatic, juicy red wine. Shove that red wine in the fridge for half an hour, take it out and then you’ll find that instantly the aromas will become way more intense, it’ll be fresher and fruitier and then what’s quite fun is you can just see how it evolves in your glass.

Sometimes, like people, the wine just needs to breathe and chill out before you’re actually going to get its true potential and particularly if you’ve got really alcoholic muscular red wine and it’s very young, you know it’s got lots of testosterone and you’re just like chill out.

Just open it up, you need to pour it out, you can pour it out into a decanter if you want to be posh, or you can pour it into a water jug. Basically, anything that will allow the wine to aerate and release it’s flavour compounds.

In regards to wine glassware, people can get really stressed out. which again is sad, if you have a beautiful wine and you’ve only got a mug available just go for it. However, if you really want to taste and appreciate the nuances in your glass of wine it can make a difference.

You really want to keep the bubbles in your sparkling wine, carbon dioxide can basically travel up the glass to keep the bubbles bubblier when you have a flute, which is this here. And always you want to hold it down here because you don’t want to heat up your sparkling wine.

You can hold a red wine glass like that if you want to warm up your red wine, that is perfectly acceptable. And I have sometimes done it, this is a white wine glass when someone serves me “whice” white wine which is as cold as ice and you then can’t taste anything. then if I want to warm it up then it’s perfectly acceptable.

By keeping it narrower, and keeping the bowl smaller you can concentrate the perfume and you can also keep it cooler. This would be perfect for your Sauvignon Blancs, your Rieslings. Anything citrusy, juicy perfumed something like this is great. However for your red wine, generally you want the surface area to be slightly rounder because red wine has got lots of layers which it needs to open up.

To really actually help along with the aeration process, do give it a swirl there is a reason why wine people swirl their glasses it’s not purely to be pretentious it actually does really help with the tasting process."

Homemade Glazed Donuts ( Doughnut Recipe ) Learn how to make donuts that taste just like krispy kreme donuts if not even better!


SUBSCRIBE to my channel here:
https://www.youtube.com/user/emmasgoodies?sub_confirmation=1

Fluffiest Homemade Donuts Recipe:

- 280 gr of  All Purpose Flour ( 2 cups + 3 tbsp flour)
- 40 gr Sugar ( 3 tbsp)
- 1/2 tsp Salt
- 1/4 tsp Nutmeg
- 1 egg
- 120 gr Whole Milk ( 1/2 cup ) ( Every flour absorbs liquids differently, so you may need an extra 2-3 tbsp of milk)
- 40 gr melted Butter ( 1/3 stick )
-  7 gr Dry Yeast ( 1 packet )


Glaze for Donuts :

- 250 gr Powdered Sugar ( 2 cups)
- 75 gr Butter ( 2/3 Stick )
- 3-5 tbsp Milk depending how thin you like your glaze
- 1 tsp Vanilla

TIP : Donuts are best freshly made. However if you'd like to make these ahead of time, once cooled store the donuts in a ziplock bag or an air-tight container and just before serving pop them in the microwave for 30 seconds. They'll be as delicious as when they’d just been made.


Enjoy!

201,D.I.Y SURFBOARD,282498,davidsjones,696,3680.0,148.0,"One day I randomly decided to try to make my own Surfboard after seeing my friend Josh do the same thing out of polystyrene boxes! Pretty much made this board out of stuff we found at local stores (apart from the leash plug, that was from a surf shop) 

Material List:

8 foot Polystyrene Sheets ( I got 2, 20mm and one 15mm)

Multi Purpose Glue 

8 foot wooded post 

Fiberglass cloth from the local boat store 

Resin from the local boat store 

Chopping board for fins

(Think thats pretty much it, if i missed anything feel free to ask about it in the comments)

Super fun project! I would recommend doing something like this if you guys are looking for something to do! Took me and my dad around 3 weeks to fully complete the board (on and off) pretty much just worked on it in our spare time! 

Once we finished the board the only thing left to do was ride it! Took it down to Mount Maunganui to Surf with the homies Josh and Ben! Josh absolutely ripped on it! as for me... I still need to get better at surfing hahahah!

Hope you guys enjoyed the video! Back to normal Snowboard videos tomorrow, just had this video saved up which I forgot to post! Yeww! If you like this vid make sure to hit that like button and subscribe to support ya boi it means alot :) cheeaa! catch ya tomorrow!

204,What's the Best Surfboard in the World?  – Starring Julian Wilson,400303,Stab Magazine,964,2086.0,55.0,"The overriding goal of this project was to see if we could answer the question: Is it possible to call a surfboard the best in the world? Sure, it’s a flawed objective. A board’s performance is subjective. But acknowledging this, we invited 12 of the world’s best shapers to each create a board for an unidentified 6’0”, 80kg CT surfer. Fast-forward some months and Julian Wilson was standing in the garage of a West Oz rental, opening two coffins full of cleanskin boards – no markings, no stickers, no pencil on the stringer, nothing identifiable – one from California, the other direct from Sydney.

And so, Jules and his blank knife collection settled into West Oz. We had 36 coloured stickers created by artist Paul McNeil and we included surplus colours and numbers just in case Jules was superstitious around any digits or shades. And, Julian’s 10-day game of Who’s Who began. Four photographers, three filmers and one producer were tasked with the story telling. The surfing is a perfect example of the output Julian Wilson could deliver if he ever went without jersey (and his own boards, for that matter). Watch it above.

234,How to Pack for the Apocalypse | OOO with Brent Rose,1429082,WIRED,739,38305.0,3054.0,"Bug-out bags/survival kits are a controversial topic. Everybody has a different philosophy about what makes a good one. This is Brent's. While bigger and heavier than a lot of the bags you'll see online, you can keep it in the closet by your front door or the trunk of your car, and you'll be prepared for an emergency that could last many days. Brent's kit doubles as a slick backpacking setup, so you'll get to know your gear extremely well, and you get to have fun with it, too.

Tech writer Brent Rose is on a quest. With a surplus of emerging technologies and scientific discoveries popping up how do we separate facts from hype? Brent takes the goods out of the box—and out of the office—to find out how the new wave of cultural phenomena really holds up.

Lyrics:
I'm hungry, this veggie burger I ate doesn't taste nothing like the real thing

Oh yeah,
(I just want sandwich)
(Ben and Jerry's ice cream with my sandwich)
(I put mustard mayo on my sandwich)
Uh, I say, uh

I don't need no mustard hold the cabbage (uh)
When I see that fat free, I'm like nah bitch (uh, uh)
She the definition of a planet
Average, I'm the definition of a sandwich (uh, ay)
I don't need no mustard hold the cabbage, uh 
Ay but when I see that fat free, I'm like nah bitch (uh, uh)
Ain't my girl the definition of a planet
Average fart, I'm the definition of a sandwich

Put the pear down and picked up the chicken, chicken, chicken
Colonel in the fucking colonel finger lickin, lickin, lickin
That colonel hit a chicken, KFC day, fuck fil a
1 slice when I'm eatin in the bed boutta fuck with her
I don't eat junk, but tonight, I'm getting stuffed fatter
Pour the cola up and put some broccoli in the trash with her
I know she eat meat, uh-huh, she gon' fuck with it
Eating tacos, uh-huh, guess I'm done with dinner

French fries in it like a trailer, I love to kale her
Addicted to the triple burger, I had to tell her
ICEE be my fortune teller
Your brownie did good, I could bake it better
Fresh cow from the farm, I think she a farmer
Cheddar cheese with some liquor, she put on some butter
That chicken be so appealing
You know she's the best cook
Chub check, one bruschetta, melon on me, am I understood
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I don't need no mustard hold the cabbage (uh)
When I see that fat free, I'm like nah bitch (uh, uh)
She the definition of a planet
Average, I'm the definition of a sandwich (uh, ay)
I don't need no mustard hold the cabbage, uh 
Ay but when I see that fat free, I'm like nah bitch (uh, uh)
Ain't my girl the definition of a planet
Average fart, I'm the definition of a sandwich

The birthplace of the chopped cheese is Hajji’s Deli in Harlem, where Salah has been managing the joint for the past 15 years. Inspired by an Arabic dish, the chopped cheese has now become a New York staple, with fans in everyone from Jay-Z to Cam’ron.

258,How-To: Action Bronson Makes the World's Best Sandwich,6082512,Munchies,430,56520.0,8113.0,"Action Bronson stopped by the MUNCHIES Test Kitchen to show us how to make his version of a simple butcher's sandwich. While a regular butcher's sandwich usually consist of some meat on bread with very little garnish, this version is as over-the-top as the man showing you how to make it. First, we start with some good Italian bread, a juicy rib-eye, and some olive oil. The second realm of this beast consists of ricotta salata and Calabrian chiles, and as if that weren't enough, a smear of grape must from the 1989 vintage of Paolo Bea Winery's top red wine. Enjoy!

259,"The Best 4K TVs Of 2019 | Five Hot Models From Sony, LG, Samsung",715861,Digital Trends,441,7309.0,253.0,"In the market for a new TV? The fact of the matter is, each television has its fair share of strengths and weaknesses. To meet your match, you first have to figure out all the features that matter to you the most.

The Sony A9G is the best of the bunch. Period. The OLED screen is fantastic, as is the software driving it. The smart features aren’t half bad, either. As such, we awarded it a rare five out of five in our review. Being the champion all-rounder it is though, it doesn’t come cheap — so it won’t appeal to everyone.

For OLED picture at a more affordable price, the LG C9 delivers 95% of the performance of Sony's OLEDs, at a somewhat more attainable price.

If you’re looking for something a bit more affordable, the TCL 6-Series could be a better fit. Loyal to a different manufacturer? Consider the Samsung Q9FN or Sony Master Series A9F. The fact of the matter is, each television has its fair share of strengths and weaknesses. To meet your match, you first have to figure out all the features that matter to you the most. Once you’ve done that, scroll down to meet the TV of your dreams.

Get PASS ROAD TEST CHECKLIST: https://www.smartdrivetest.com/pass-road-test-checklist SUBSCRIBE TODAY! ►  http://youtube.com/c/smartdrivetest 

When a learner driver comes to a complete stop at a STOP signed intersection, the wheels must stop turning for a brief moment. For new drivers, this action of stopping the vehicle completely can be difficult to determine.

The body and the chassis are the 2 main components of a vehicle. As the brakes are applied, the body actually moves forward of the chassis. To prevent whiplash and bring the vehicle to a complete stop, the driver releases the brakes in the instant before coming to a stop, and then reapplies the brakes.

This technique allows the body to settle over the chassis in its natural resting position and brings the vehicle--any vehicle--to a gentle stop.

Before proceeding, the driver scans the intersection. If she/he can't see, creep forward until you can see the intersection and the cross traffic, Give the right-of-way to other road users and when the way is clear proceed through the intersection.

As you can see in the video, few--if any--drivers actually stop at a STOP signed intersection. For new drivers, this action of other drivers creates social pressure, which can be difficult for new drivers to overcome.

Yet for the purposes of a road test, drivers must come to a COMPLETE stop at a STOP signed intersection. After coming to a complete stop at most STOP signed intersections, it is unlikely that the driver will be able to see the cross-traffic. Therefore, s/he has to move forward to get a clear view. And be sure to treat the intersection as a YIELD after coming to a complete stop and give the right-of-way to all other road users.

275,Who Has the Right of Way at a 4-Way (All-Way) STOP Sign,190483,Smart Drive Test,260,1819.0,73.0,"4-Way or All-WAY STOPs are complicated and a must know for a road test - watch the video. Get Your ROAD TEST CHECKLIST: https://www.smartdrivetest.com/pass-road-test-checklist  SUBSCRIBE TODAY! ►  http://youtube.com/c/smartdrivetest

#4waystoprightofway #smartdrivetest #passfirsttime

First & foremost, know that there are different right-of-way rules for 2-Way and 4-Way STOP signed intersections.

GENERAL right-of-way rules at intersections are:
1) Major road over minor road;
2) Straight through traffic over turning traffic;
3) Right turning traffic over left turning traffic.

For a 4-Way (All-Way) STOP signed intersection the basic right-of-way rules are: the first person to arrive, or give the right-of-way to the person on the right. 

All drivers must give the right-of-way to pedestrians and scooters.

Cyclists and riders must obey the same rules as drivers.

And remember: the right-of-way is never taken, it is always given.

When 4-Way STOPs are busy, the lanes of traffic take turns proceeding through the intersection.

If two left-turning vehicles arrive at the intersection at the same time from opposite sides, the two vehicles can turn left simultaneously.

Turning vehicles must give the right-of-way to straight through traffic.

Good luck on your road test!

290,How Detroit Turned Trucks Into Luxury Vehicles,329369,CNBC,901,4859.0,265.0,"In the automotive industry, the word luxury often conjures images of sleek German sedans and sports cars. American carmakers have often struggled to compete at the higher end of this market. But in recent years a new phenomenon has occurred. As the overall market shifts away from sedans and SUVs, a new market is emerging for plush, tech-rich, and high-priced premium pickup trucks.

The spectacular Mercedes-Benz Future Truck 2025 study will be providing a visually exciting and technically feasible take on the long-distance Mercedes Self Driving Truck of tomorrow at the 2014 International Commercial Vehicle show (IAA). In ten years' time, Self Driving Truck s could be driving autonomously on motorways. Transport efficiency will increase, traffic will be safer for all road users, and fuel consumption and CO2 emissions will be further reduced. To do this Mercedes Self Driving Truck connects existing assistance systems with enhanced sensors to the ""Highway Pilot"" system. Mercedes Self Driving Truck / Autonomous driving is already possible at realistic speeds and in realistic motorway traffic situations. The Mercedes-Benz Future Truck 2025 provides a glimpse of the future shape of trucks.
The Mercedes Self Driving Truck technology of tomorrow is already reality at Daimler Trucks. The Mercedes-Benz Future Truck 2025 constitutes a revolution in efficiency, safety and networking, a revolution for road traffic and its infrastructure, for professional driving and for the road transport sector. This is not a new truck, but rather the key element in the interconnected transport system of the future. Mercedes Self Driving Truck is being developed as part of the ""Shaping Future Transportation"" initiative by Daimler Trucks to conserve resources and reduce emissions of all kinds. Other aims for Mercedes Self Driving Truck are to ensure the highest possible level of traffic safety and to boost networking with intelligent data management considerably for tailor-made vehicle and service solutions.
The prototype demonstrated the exciting capabilities of the Future Truck 2025 back in the summer at speeds of up to 80 km/h in realistic traffic situations on a section of the A14 motorway in Magdeburg, Germany. Now the thrilling exterior and interior of that same vehicle are being revealed. The tractor unit combined with an aerodynamically optimised trailer celebrates its world premiere as a study at the International Commercial Vehicles show (IAA).
The technology behind this exciting façade is no less impressive. The Mercedes-Benz Future Truck 2025 is not, for instance, part of a platoon. It does not need to be daisy-chained to other vehicles either. Radar sensors and camera technology enable the Future Truck to drive autonomously, independently of other vehicles or central control stations. Its technical features are thus crucial in giving the Mercedes-Benz Future Truck 2025 its outstanding capabilities as an autonomous vehicle. For Mercedes-Benz the culmination of this is the highly intelligent ""Highway Pilot"" system, which resembles the autopilot on an aircraft.
A radar sensor in the lower area of the front end scans the road ahead at long and short range. The front radar sensor has a range of 250 m and scans an 18-degree segment. The short-range sensor has a range of 70 m and scans a 130-degree segment. The radar sensor is the basis for the proximity control and emergency braking safety systems already available today.
A stereo camera installed above the instrument support behind the windscreen keeps the area ahead of the vehicle in view. This is currently the location of a mono-camera if optional Lane Keeping Assist is ordered. The range of the stereo camera is 100 m, and it scans an area of 45 degrees horizontally and 27 degrees vertically.
The stereo camera of the Mercedes-Benz Future Truck 2025 identifies single- or two-lane roads, pedestrians, moving and stationary objects, all objects within the monitored area and also the road surface. The camera recognises everything that contrasts with the background, and is therefore also able to measure clearances precisely. The front stereo camera also registers the information on traffic signs.
In addition to object and distance recognition, the stereo camera recognises lane markings as a major function for autonomous lane guidance.
The road surface to the left and right of the truck is monitored by radar sensors installed in the sides. They are located on the left and right, ahead of the tractor unit's rear axle. The sensors have a range of 60 m and cover an angle of 170 degrees in the longitudinal direction.
For Mercedes-Benz, the planned introduction of Blind Spot Assist over the next few years is a major step paving the way for the Future Mercedes Self Driving Truck and underlines Mercedes-Benz's role in pioneering maximum road safety."
